            "The Spice Industry has seen progress at a rapid pace in the past few decades. Today, it is a $3.2 billion, 1 million tons industry. The increasing awareness among world-wide consumers on the wholesome goodness of spices, development of new products, processes and applications have helped the industry scale new heights.",

WSO seeks to achieve its objectives by involving all its stakeholders—the general public, the industry, the academia and the end-users.
